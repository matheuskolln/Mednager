# Mednager

## How to run

For put server up, you need to have docker-compose installed, for install check this [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

When you got docker-compose installed you can run that command:

```bash
    scripts/app_start.sh
```

and the API will start.

## How to test requests to API

For make easier to perfom requests you can use [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install/), and import the config with all requests for API (default-requests.json)

After that you can play with each request and change data (if needed) on body section.
